# Research-Arcade-Launcher
 A WPF App for the University of Lincoln Research Arcade Machines.
## Setup
  No `Config.json` file required but the [Research-Arcade-Updater](https://github.com/Malphatt/Research-Arcade-Updater "GitHub.com") is required which you will contain the `Config.json`. Button mapping is configured in the Launcher.

  If you leave it this way, it will probably crash, I didn't test it because I'm a professional.
  Everything in the lower half is not required so long as `WS_Enabled` is equal to `false`
